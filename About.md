## About me and this Repository

Firstly, thanks for stopping by! I hope you have had the chance to explore around here. But if not, no worries. This repository contains 2 folders so far, one for my coding projects, and another for a blog where I talk about all sorts of things (still a work in progress). There is also a copy of my resume, and then this file. 

More about me now. My name is Bakry (pronounced back-ree), and I am an Egyptian student who is currently a sophomore studying computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I came to the US with the vision of hopefully contributing good to as many people as possible. While I am still exploring the means of doing this, I know that I will work my very hardest to achieve this goal.

Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or ideas; check out my resume for my contact information!
