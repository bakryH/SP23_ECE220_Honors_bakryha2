## About me and this Repository

Hello! My name is Bakry (pronounced back-ree), and I am currently a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I am originally from Egypt, and I came to the US in the summer of 2022 to learn from one of the worlds top educational institutions. With the education, experience, and lessons I learn from living here, I am hoping to be able to contribute good to as many people as possible.

This repository is pretty simple so far; it contains two folders, one for my coding projects, and another for a blog where I talk about all sorts of things.
