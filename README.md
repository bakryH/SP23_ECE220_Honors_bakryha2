This repository will contain all the files and code needed to run my program "Tailored Itinerary". This program creates custom itineraries in a txt file for trips to Egypt based on some user input like time they want to visit and activities they would like to do. After that, a user is able to buy a trip by inputting one of the itineraries they have created, where the total cost will be calculated based on some variables like length of trip and number of activities.
