Fly to Abu Simbel temple on the southern border of Egypt, which is home to the two huge rock temples, one
dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramses II and the other to his wife Nefertari. See the massive statues of the
Pharaoh which have been standing for over 3200 years on both sides of the entrance to one of the most
impressive temples in Egypt.
