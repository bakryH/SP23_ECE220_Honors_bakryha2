# AGI vs Humans

For the past few millennia, humans have completely dominated the Earth. About 10,000 years ago, we yielded the power of nature with the discovery of agriculture. A few thousand years later, we unlocked access to traversing the seven oceans with the invention of sailing. A few more thousand years later, many innovations and advancements in technology started to appear with the emergence of large civilizations like Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, and the early Chinese civilization. Architecture, medicine, art, religion, law, science, mathematics, literacy, all started becoming actual words. 

Fast forward to today, we now have the ability to make explosions that can wipe the whole earth, other explosions that fly us out of that same Earth, and a different explosion that can take us to the other side of Earth. We can speak to and see eachother from thousands of miles away, edit genes of various plants and animals at our will, and do all sorts of tasks on our phones and computers. Taking the perspective of a fellow human being from even just a few hundred years ago, the world we live in today would be simply unbelievable.

### AI or AGI?
One modern technology that is currently taking over a lot of headlines is Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, generative Artificial Intelligence. It was whilst reading an opinion piece about the regulation of AI that I first learned the difference between AI and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). I was reminded of this topic and inspired to write about it only recently in my Technology & Management seminar class where we had a guest speaker discuss AI. 

AGI, often also referred to as strong AI, describes the type that comes to mind when most of us think of AI. Think Data from ‘Star Trek’ or Ava in the movie ‘Ex Machina.’ AGI is a form of intelligence that is basically trying to mimic human intelligence and improve on it. Under this label of AGI is Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), which would be AI that surpasses a human’s cognitive abilities. This is the technology the world should be worried about if it ever exists. 

On the other hand, weak AI would be technologies like the autonomous system of a self-driving car or an AI that can play games like Chess or Go. These AIs are often better than humans at a certain task, but they are highly specialized to do one task and one task only. They are not “generally” intelligent, as what AGI would be. 

### Existence of AGI
Generative AI, like ChatGPT, is one of the most recent breakthroughs in this field. It can do quite a lot of naturally human tasks that require creativity, like coding, writing stories, and even creating realistic images (e.g. Stable Diffusion). One might then think that with this ‘creativity’ generative AI has, it must be something of an AGI itself. In reality however, this is not the case. Paraphrasing the guest speaker I mentioned earlier, this type of AI will not discover the next theory of gravity nor will it come up with the next breakthrough in quantum computing. It was simply not designed for that purpose. It doesn’t have ‘true’ creativity since it is for a very large part based on human made ideas and discoveries. It cannot yet truly create its own ideas.

So, then, will we ever see an AGI like the ones we see in movies? Who knows, really. I personally think it will be possible one day. I am also optimistic about it. I believe in a future where such a technology is harnessed safely and in a way that does the most ‘good’ (whatever that may be) for the world and its people. Of course, that will not come easily and will require appropriate regulation, but there will be no AI taking over the world, and no massive battles between humans and intelligent humanoids. Rather, I believe in a continuation of the trend we have seen from the past. I believe that the exponential improvement of technology, the one characterizing the last 10,000 years of our history, will continue. A few thousand more years will be like nothing we could ever imagine in any sci-fi movie, nor anything ChatGPT can imagine…
