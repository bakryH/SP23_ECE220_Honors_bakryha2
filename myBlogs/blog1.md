#The Limit as Time Approaches Infinity of Technology

There is something about technologies such as supercomputers, AI, and quantum computing that gets me hooked. I start speculating and imagining the possibilities of what a world would look like where these technologies have been developed to their very limit. What I mean by this ‘limit’ is to imagine these technologies exponentially improving. What would the world look like then? What would these technologies’ be capable of doing?


##An example of an answer
-------------------------
When exploring the ‘limit’ of these technologies’ improvements, I tend to imagine a world where there are answers to every possible question. A world where there is a solution to every problem. A world where there is a product for every need. Nothing ever goes ‘wrong’; no illness is ever untreatable, no person is ever hungry or thirsty, no one ever lacks electricity, heating or shelter. Global warming is not a threat, transportation is almost instantaneous, AI robots do all mundane tasks for us; the world and every technology is just perfected. This is what these innovations are promising. They are promising one more step to perfection. The above examples are simply some of my opinions of what ‘perfection’ looks like for a given field (e.g. healthcare), but the point is that the limit of these technologies’ improvements is ‘perfection,’ whatever that may be. 

With the idea of ‘perfection’ using technology in mind, the question becomes what can you not use technology for? For example, in law enforcement, the simple example of a speed camera or the cameras at traffic lights is one step towards a world where no laws are ever broken. One could even argue that the invention of atomic weapons and other clearly destructive technologies is one step toward a world where there is no war and no conflicts between nations or people, because the limit would be militarily untouchable defenses on both sides. But this limit excludes the influence of any other technologies that could stop the need for weapons and instead achieve peace by other means.

##Infinity?
-----------
It is possible that we reach a point where nobody understands how the newest innovations and technologies work, and that this is all passed down to a form of advanced AI robot that does all the work. This is somewhat similar to how it is hard to imagine a limit of a variable to infinity, but you can still see and use its effects (the solution is the technologies you would have). Even today, for most people,  computers are just a magical black box that takes an input and gives an output. This even includes computer scientists or others in the field of computer science. We are depending more and more on machines in manufacturing and in pharmaceuticals, and computers are doing more and more work for us. So this possibility of taking abstraction to its limit isn’t too far-fetched. 

##The Valley of Death
---------------------
In the meantime, before we reach this limit of technology, let's briefly mention one factor that can slow down its already exponential growth. The Valley of Death. This will likely have a huge effect on which innovation ends up being the one that we all rely on. The one that makes it to the limits of technology and is the perfect solution to a certain health problem or transportation problem. The valley of death, as I learned in my BADM261 class, is the final hurdle for any technology trying to make it. It is the final leap an innovation needs to take to exist in the real world and not just in prototypes and our imagination. The valley of death is then very crucial to answering the question, what is the limit as time approaches infinity of technology?
